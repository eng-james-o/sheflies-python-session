# Project Overview

This repo contains a demo project which was used during a Python session for the SheFLies Mentorship Program. This project is focused on analyzing flight log data and includes Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks to process, visualize, and generate insights from the data. The development process of the data generator is documented in the Jupyter Notebook.

## File Descriptions

### Python Files

1. **data-generator.py**  
   - **Purpose**:  
     This script generates synthetic flight log data and saves it to a CSV file.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Generates random flight data, including timestamps, altitude, speed, and battery levels.  
     - Saves the generated data to `flight_data.csv`.  
   - **Python Concepts Used**:  
     - Random data generation using the `random` module.  
     - File I/O for writing CSV files.  
     - Looping and conditional logic for data generation.

2. **log-analyser.py**  
   - **Purpose**:  
     This script processes and analyzes flight log data from the generated CSV file.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Reads and parses flight log data.  
     - Calculates basic metrics like flight duration and maximum altitude.  
   - **Python Concepts Used**:  
     - File I/O for reading CSV files.  
     - Data manipulation using lists and dictionaries.  
     - Basic statistical calculations.

3. **log-analyser-advanced.py**  
   - **Purpose**:  
     This script extends the functionality of `log-analyser.py` by adding advanced metrics and visualizations.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Calculates additional metrics like average speed and total distance traveled.  
     - Creates animated visualizations for altitude, speed, and distance over time.  
   - **Python Concepts Used**:  
     - File I/O using `pandas` for CSV handling.  
     - Data visualization using `matplotlib` and `FuncAnimation`.  
     - Object-oriented programming for managing plot objects.

### Jupyter Notebook

1. **data-generator-1.ipynb**  
   - **Purpose**:  
     This notebook documents the step-by-step development process of the `data-generator.py` script.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - Breaks down the code into cells for better readability and explanation.  
     - Includes markdown cells to explain each block of code.  
   - **Python Concepts Used**:  
     - Same as `data-generator.py`, with additional focus on documentation and explanation.

### Data File

1. **flight_data.csv**  
   - **Purpose**:  
     This file contains the synthetic flight log data generated by `data-generator.py`.  
   - **Structure**:  
     - Columns include timestamps, longitude, latitude, altitude, speed, and battery levels.

## Python Concepts Used in the Project

1. **Data Handling**:  
   - Reading and writing CSV files using `pandas` and the built-in `csv` module.  

2. **Random Data Generation**:  
   - Using the `random` module to generate synthetic data.  

3. **Date and Time Manipulation**:  
   - Parsing timestamps and calculating elapsed time using the `datetime` module.  

4. **Mathematical Operations**:  
   - Calculating cumulative sums, averages, and distances.  

5. **Visualization**:  
   - Creating static and animated plots using `matplotlib`.  

6. **Libraries and Frameworks**:  
   - `pandas` for data manipulation.  
   - `matplotlib` for visualization.  
   - `FuncAnimation` for creating animations.
